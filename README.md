## What it is

Corsair ships the Xeneon Edge™ widget layer only for Windows, through iCUE. On
macOS the 2560×720 panel arrives as a blank second display. Vardek rebuilds
that widget layer natively for the Mac: a full-screen, touch-driven grid of
six bundled widgets plus any Vardek-format add-on you drop in, running
entirely on your machine. Free, macOS 13+, signed and notarized by Apple.

## Local-first

Whatever can run on your machine does. Clocks, the day/night terminator,
life-progress bars, and more are pure local math with no network at all; others
(like the ISS tracker) fetch only a tiny bit of data and compute the rest
on-device. When a widget does need live data — weather, launches, earthquakes —
it makes only the exact API calls its manifest lists, and nothing else leaves
your Mac. API keys live in the macOS Keychain, never in a plaintext config file.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (CPU/GPU temperature sensors are Apple Silicon-only)
- A Corsair Xeneon Edge™ over USB-C (optional — Vardek also runs on any display
  so you can try it)

## Install

1. Download `Vardek-<version>.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/vardekapp/Vardek/releases/latest).
2. Open it and drag **Vardek** to **Applications**.
3. Launch Vardek. The app is signed and notarized by Apple.

Verify the download against `SHA256SUMS.txt` (attached to each release) if you like:

```
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## Upgrading to 1.0.19

**1. Install the app.** Quit Vardek, open `Vardek-1.0.19.dmg`, and drag
**Vardek** into **Applications**, replacing the old copy. Open Vardek.

**2. If you use add-on widgets** from
[vardekapp/vardek-widgets](https://github.com/vardekapp/vardek-widgets), they
were renamed from `com.vardek.<name>` to `app.vardek.<name>` and must be
reinstalled — the old copies will not load:

1. Get the latest add-ons:
   `git clone https://github.com/vardekapp/vardek-widgets` (or `git pull` in your
   existing copy).
2. Install each add-on you use:
   `./install-addon.sh app.vardek.<name>` — for example
   `./install-addon.sh app.vardek.world-clocks`. This also removes the old
   `com.vardek.<name>` copy.
   
   *Manual alternative:* copy the `app.vardek.<name>` folder into
   `~/Library/Application Support/Vardek/widgets/` and delete the old
   `com.vardek.<name>` folder.
4. In Vardek, open **Admin** (⌘A) → **Widgets** and click **Rescan**.
5. Click **Approve** on each add-on.

Widgets you had already placed on your pages switch to the renamed add-on
automatically and keep their settings.

**3. UniFi Network or Flight Tracker users:** open the widget's settings in
Admin and enter your API key again. Keys saved under the old add-on name are not
carried over.

**4. Your own widgets:** widget IDs starting with `com.vardek.` or
`installation.` are reserved and won't load. Give your widget a different ID
(for example `com.yourname.mywidget`), then Rescan and Approve.

**Coming from 1.0.17 or earlier?** Also read
[What changed in 1.0.18](#what-changed-in-1018): Admin opens only inside the app
(⌘A — the browser Admin at `127.0.0.1:8137` is gone), and every user-installed
widget must be approved once in Admin.

## Documentation

- [Setup](docs/setup.md) — install and first launch.
- [Mac display setup](https://vardek.app/mac-setup/) — recommended window sizes if you don't have a Xeneon Edge.
- [Touch setup](docs/touch-driver.md) — enable the touchscreen (community driver).
- [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) — common fixes.
- [Widget authoring guide](https://vardek.app/widgets/authoring/) — build your own widget.
- **In-app Help** (Vardek menu → Help, or ⌘?) — per-widget help pages, kept in sync with each widget's current behavior.

## Widgets

Six widgets ship bundled, curated and fixed at install. Drop your own into
`~/Library/Application Support/Vardek/widgets/`, press **Rescan** in Admin →
Widgets, and approve it once — no app update needed. Widget IDs starting with
`com.vardek.` are reserved for the bundled widgets; your own widgets need a
different ID.

**Add-on widgets:** install more after the fact — no app update — from
**[vardekapp/vardek-widgets](https://github.com/vardekapp/vardek-widgets)**.
That repo is open source; grab a widget, drop it in the folder above (or run its
`install-addon.sh`), press **Rescan**, and approve it in Admin. Official add-ons
use `app.vardek.*` IDs since 1.0.19.
[Authoring guide](https://vardek.app/widgets/authoring/) and PRs welcome there too.

**Community add-ons:** [kevinelliott/vardek-widgets](https://github.com/kevinelliott/vardek-widgets)
by Kevin Elliott — a separate, community-maintained collection of 100+
add-on widgets (clocks, weather, space, finance, aviation, generative art).
Always review any public widget before installing; install same as any
add-on widget above.

| ![Weather](assets/screenshots/weather.png) | ![Calendar](assets/screenshots/calendar.png) |
| **Weather** — current conditions, hourly, and a five-day outlook | **Calendar** — hero date with a three-month grid, instant first paint |
| ![System Sensors](assets/screenshots/system-sensors.png) | |
| **System Sensors** — CPU, memory, and network instruments that go amber past real thresholds and dim when data stops | |

**Also bundled:** **Clock** (time, kept honest by local math with no network at
all), **Sensor Gauge** (one sensor, one dial — pick the reading that matters),
and **Macro Pad** (touch buttons on the panel, wired to what you run most) —
see them live in-app (⌘? → per-widget Help) or via the ⌘A Admin panel.

## Admin

Manage everything from the Admin panel — open it as an app window (**Vardek menu →
Open Admin**, ⌘A). Placement,
settings, sensors, brightness, profiles — no config files to hand-edit.

Arranging the panel is direct manipulation: **drag widgets onto a live page map**
(or between pages, or onto a "New page" target), resize with per-widget size
chips, and filter the library as you type. The whole editor also works from the
keyboard, removals ask first and offer a 10-second **Undo**, and every change
confirms with a "Saved ✓" pulse.

## Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the Corsair Xeneon Edge work on a Mac?</strong></summary>
<br>

The panel does. Over USB-C or HDMI, macOS sees the Xeneon Edge™ as an ordinary
2560×720 second display. The widget layer does not: Corsair delivers that
through iCUE on Windows. On macOS the panel is a blank strip of desktop until
you run something on it. Vardek is what runs on it — see the
[full iCUE vs Vardek comparison](https://vardek.app/vs-icue/).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Vardek send my data anywhere?</strong></summary>
<br>

No. The daemon opens no network port at all; it runs as a signature-verified
child process of the app and talks to it over private pipes. No
cloud, no account, no telemetry. The only network traffic is the API calls a
data widget explicitly makes, and those go through an audited proxy limited to
hosts the widget declares in its manifest. Full detail on the
[privacy page](https://vardek.app/privacy/).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Vardek use iCUE widgets?</strong></summary>
<br>

Not directly. Building an iCUE widget today means installing Corsair's
WidgetBuilder CLI, scaffolding and validating the widget with it, then
packaging it into a `.icuewidget` file that gets imported through iCUE's own
**+** button — a manifest schema (`author`, `preview_icon`,
`supported_devices`, …) and config model (`<meta name="x-icue-property">`
tags, `onICUEInitialized`) built for iCUE only. Vardek widgets are a plain
folder — `manifest.json` plus `index.html`, no CLI, no packaging step, no
iCUE install required. Community add-ons built for Vardek install by dropping
the folder into the widgets folder, rescan, approve once in Admin — see the
[widget authoring guide](https://vardek.app/widgets/authoring/).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does Vardek cost?</strong></summary>
<br>

Nothing. Vardek is free, closed source, and distributed as a signed and
notarized DMG through GitHub Releases. No paid tier, no subscription, no
account.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a Xeneon Edge to run Vardek?</strong></summary>
<br>

No. Vardek runs full-screen on any macOS display, so you can try it before the
Edge™ arrives. The layout is built for the panel's 2560×720 shape and reads
best there, but nothing requires that hardware.
</details>

## What changed in 1.0.19

Security release; every user should update. Full notes on the
[release page](https://github.com/vardekapp/Vardek/releases/tag/v1.0.19).

- **Tighter widget network rules.** A widget's allowed destinations are checked
  by exact host and port, private and reserved network addresses are blocked in
  every form (including IPv6 transition addresses), request headers must be
  well-formed, and upstream cookies never reach a widget.
- **Sturdier daemon.** Malformed widget requests are rejected with an error
  instead of stopping the app's background process.
- **Limits on widgets.** Each widget has a message budget; only visible widgets
  can change pages or ask to open a link, and after you cancel a link the same
  widget has to wait before asking again.
- **Official add-ons renamed to `app.vardek.*`** so they load again (1.0.18
  reserved the old `com.vardek.*` names for built-in widgets).

See [Upgrading to 1.0.19](#upgrading-to-1019) for what to do after installing.

## What changed in 1.0.18

Security release. Full notes on the
[release page](https://github.com/vardekapp/Vardek/releases/tag/v1.0.18).

- **No network port.** The daemon no longer listens on `127.0.0.1:8137`. The app
  launches it over private pipes and both sides verify the other's Developer ID
  signature before any settings or Keychain data are opened.
- **Admin is in-app only.** ⌘A or Vardek menu → Open Admin. Browser Admin is gone.
- **Widget approval.** User-installed widgets must be approved once in Admin
  before they can use the network proxy or a stored key. Changed files or
  permissions ask again. Keys are scoped to the approved widget; on upgrade,
  Vardek offers to migrate existing keys and leaves them untouched if you decline.
- **Hardened widget runtime.** Response-level sandbox/CSP on every widget
  document, hash-pinned scripts (no inline `onclick`/`onerror`), no navigation
  inside widget documents, external links need a native confirmation.
- **Bounded work.** Proxy requests and Macro Pad actions are rate-limited per
  widget and globally; a failed update check now says so instead of "up to date".

## Privacy

Local-only by design. Since 1.0.18 nothing listens on any port, not even
loopback: the app launches its daemon as a child process and the two talk over
private pipes after verifying each other's code signature. The only traffic that leaves your Mac is the specific
API call a widget you enable makes (e.g. Weather fetching a forecast), limited
to the exact hosts that widget declares. Full details at
[vardek.app/privacy](https://vardek.app/privacy/).
